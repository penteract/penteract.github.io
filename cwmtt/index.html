<h1> Chess With Multiverse Timetravel (4D) </h1>

Currently with history clicks.

Note that there are bugs in this version, related to Haskell and webassembly. I blame the compiler :P

This works in the latest Firefox and Chrome (April 2023), but does not work in Edge under defualt settings. You need a font with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_symbols_in_Unicode#The_basic_12_chess_pieces>unicode chess pieces</a> (you should see them here: ♙♖♘♗♕♔♟︎♜♞♝♛♚).

Useful UI hint: Holding Shift while using the scroll wheel scrolls horizontally.
