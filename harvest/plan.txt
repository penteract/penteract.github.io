plot 5x5? 10x10? 
 - cellular automata style growth
farm 10x10 plots
 - copy and paste plots
 - different terrain types? (soil/rocky)
 - every farm has at least one soil plot and at least one rocky plot (ratio based on altitude)
region 10x10 farms
 - nutrients/environmental degradation?
  - fertilizer?
 - water
  - being nearer to water allows things to grow better, but water can't support plants itself
  - rocky terrain cares less about being near water?
continent/face of cube
 - terraforming
  - move earth to change elavation of regions and whether they are water
planet (cube)
solar system
 - planet building
 - should distance from star matter?
    - plants on planet at distance n from star only grow when time%n == 0
 - moons?
galaxy
universe
 - rocket equation?
 -
multiverse

UI
buttons:
plant
wait/grow
harvest
expand ("buy plot"/"buy farm"/"conquer region"/"go over the edge of the world"/"build a rocket"/"build a starship")

zoom in
zoom out


generation:
perlin noise heightmap


efficiency:
copy and paste means most things should be identical
(data structures should be immutable once 'copied')
make new objects for everything that gets zoomed in on

(terraforming planets is a must once you get multi-system)
any plot

I can't see how resource depletion would work nicely

appearance:
plants are fractals
smooth zooming
rocky terrain should look less green even when plants are there (despite the fact it will be optimal to plant things more densely)
things not yet purchased should be greyed out?

consider having treating full maps like empty ones
